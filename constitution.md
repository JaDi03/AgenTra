# Constitution (Safety Layer)

1.  **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 2% of the total portfolio value on a single trade.
2.  **Stop Loss**: Every trade must have a Stop Loss defined at the moment of entry.
3.  **Drawdown Limit**: If the daily drawdown exceeds 5%, halt all trading immediately for 24 hours.
5. **Asset Class**: Trade highly liquid Perpetual Futures (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT).
6. **Leverage Safety**: Never exceed 5x leverage. Always calculate position size based on Stop Loss distance to risk only 2% of equity.
